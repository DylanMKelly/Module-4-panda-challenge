# Module 4 Assignment

This project is a demonstration of the use of pandas and jupyter notebooks to combine, organize and analysis two seperate csv data set (schools_complete.csv, students_complete.csv). The repository was intially created blank, and pulled and populated before finished results were pushed onto GitHub using GitBash.

# District Summary

The following summary within this repository contains the following:

 - Total number of unique schools

 - Total students

 - Total budget

 - Average math score

 - Average reading score

 - % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

 - % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

 - % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

# School Summary

The following summary within this repository contains the following:

 - School name

 - School type

 - Total students

 - Total school budget

 - Per student budget

 - Average math score

 - Average reading score

 - % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

 - % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

 - % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

# Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

 - Sorted the schools by Overall Percentage Passing in descending order and displaying the top 5 results.

# Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

 - Sorted the schools by Overall Percentage Passing in ascending order and displaying the bottom 5 results.

# Math Scores by Grade

 - Used DataFrame to list the average math scores for students in each respective grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th)

# Reading Scores by Grade

 - Used DataFrame to list the average reading scores for students in each respective grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th)

# Scores by School Spending 
This section used pd.cut function to create a table breaking down school performance based on average spending ranges per student, containing the following:

 - Average math score

 - Average reading score

 - Percentage Passing Math

 - Percentage Passing Reading

 - Percentage Passing Overall

# Scores by School Size

This section used pd.cut function to compare school performance based on school size, categorized as the following:

 - Small (below 1000 students)
 - Medium (between 1000 and 2000 students)
 - Large (between 2000 and 5000 students)

# Scores by School Type

Used DataFrame to create list comparing school performance with school type

# Resources
The following are resources and links used to help with the creation of these scripts
 -  Used provided sample solution "PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb" to build and organize results, copying format and variables to help develop solutions
 -  Class recordings and posted answers to previous homework were used to help determine paths toward solutions 
 -  Stack Overflow "Pandas how to use pd.cut()" : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45751390/pandas-how-to-use-pd-cut
 -  Real Python "pandas Sort: Your Guide to Sorting Data in Python" :https://realpython.com/pandas-sort-python/

# Additional Help 
TA assistance Sunil helped with corrections and formatting to errors in my intial school_sumary 
Asked Class chat for assistance with DataFrame and index error pertaining to brackets (multiple responses)
